# Kotlin-weather-app

Asks permission for location usage
On Acceptance- loads weather by parsing location or last known location to openweathermap and displays the data in the textfields
On Denial - prompts user for zipcode, enters zipcode to a text field ( in the future will parse to openweathermap and get the  weather)
on no connection*(airplane mode)*   I havent dealt with yet
Also will align images of where the sun is based on the time of day
